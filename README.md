# Weather Monitoring System

## 🌤️ About the Project
The **Weather Monitoring System** is an IoT-based project designed to measure and display real-time weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. The system collects data from sensors and transmits it for monitoring and analysis.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time temperature, humidity, and pressure monitoring
- IoT-enabled data transmission and logging
- LCD/LED display for on-spot weather information
- Cloud-based or local dashboard visualization
- Alerts for extreme weather conditions

## 🔧 Components Used
- **Microcontroller**: ESP32/Arduino
- **Sensors**:
  - DHT11/DHT22 (Temperature & Humidity Sensor)
  - BMP280/BME280 (Pressure Sensor)
- **Display**: OLED/LCD Display (Optional)
- **Communication**: Wi-Fi, GSM (for remote monitoring)
- **Power Source**: Battery/Solar Panel (Optional)

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions
1. Connect the sensors to the microcontroller according to the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the provided firmware using Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
3. Configure Wi-Fi/GSM settings for data transmission.
4. Deploy the system in an outdoor/indoor environment.
5. View the collected data on the display or cloud dashboard.

## 📡 Data Visualization
The system supports:
- Web-based dashboard (using Thingspeak, Blynk, or Firebase)
- Local OLED/LCD display
- Mobile App (Optional)

## 📌 Usage
- Smart agriculture and greenhouse monitoring
- Industrial environmental monitoring
- Smart cities and weather stations
- Home automation and climate control

## 📜 License
This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
